          more experienced people who have worked in travel all their lives.
          Merging friendly and approachable service with knowledge and

        <h1>Community impact</h1>
        <p>
          When they first arrived in Morocco in 2003, Charlie and his wife Mel
          created and managed an ecological building project that employed
          nearly 100 local workers. From these early days, it was clear to them
          that the impact of foreign investment and project creation could be
          highly positive if approached with a high degree of sensitivity to the
          local culture. Since then, we have paid special attention to
          supporting local economies and working responsibly with our partners
          and suppliers to ensure that all that can be done, is done, to spread
          the benefits, and that local resources are carefully managed. A few
          years ago we came across a project that touched us all, and we now
          proudly contribute to Fiers et Forts, a project to protect children in
          danger. So every time you book you are helping to fund facilities and
          a better life for its children.
